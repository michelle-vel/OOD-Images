    quit to quit program

1. Text Scripting

     - Create a new run config. with an empty command line argument
     - Run configuration
     - See intro message with possible commands
     - Use keyboard to type commands accordingly in Run Window and hit enter.
     - Type 'quit' to quit program.

2. JAR File/File in Command-Line Argument

     - Parse all commands into a text file ending with "quit".
       Example (store the following in a file.txt)
       load res/33grid.bmp grid
       vertical-flip grid verticalgrid
       horizontal-flip grid horizontalgrid
       red-component grid redgrid
       green-component grid greengrid
       blue-component grid bluegrid
       brighten 50 grid brightgrid
       darken 50 grid darkgrid
       value grid valuegrid
       intensity grid intensitygrid
       blur grid blurgrid
       sharpen grid sharpengrid
       luma grid lumagrid
       greyscale grid greyscalegrid
       sepia grid sepiagrid
       save res/sharpengrid.bmp sharpengrid
       quit

     - Create a new run config. with the following arguments: "-file FILE-PATH.txt"
       (* If file is in project, use relative path. Use absolute path for foreign text files)
       Example: "-file CommandsBMP.txt"
     - Run configuration.

     3. Run GUI to interactively process images with buttons and simultaneously see its RGB
        intensity values on a histogram.

      GUI conditions:
      - Must have a file imported first, before applying any transformations
      - The histogram will automatically update for each color transformation

      To start:
      - Run the ViewProgram class OR
      - Default option: double click on the jar file to run.

      - The GUI opens with no image loaded and displays all available commands as buttons
        in the bottom half of the scrollable window.
      - To load: click the "Open a file" button and navigate to a valid image (.png, .ppm, .jpg, .bmp)
        on your desktop.
      - The image will appear in the top half of the GUI in an image window. It will be scrollable
        if the image larger than the default window size.
      - You can now click on any of the available transformation buttons on the bottom panel.
        How to use each operation >>>>
      - To brighten or darken, first input an increment in the empty window to the left, then
        click "brighten an image" or "darken an image".
      - To flip, get rgb components, greyscale, intensity, value, luma, blur sepia, or sharpen
        an image, click the respective buttons after an image has been loaded.
      - Multiple operations can be applied to an image. Image is modified after each op.
      - To apply operation on original image, reload the image with "Open a file".
      - The picture being displayed will update for each transformation
      - The histogram will update accordingly with the RGB and intensity (grey) values.
      - To save: press the "Save a file" button and navigate to a valid file path.
